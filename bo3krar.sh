# Hi, I'm BO3K 404 SHL founder of Kryptón Security, here I leave you the free code of the crack of rar files.
# Be free to modify it, it works with a very complete dictionary (diccionary.txt).
#But you can modify it with data you have from the author or use another available dictionary.
# I will be adding several dictionaries.
#This Tool was created for Error 404.
#Thanks to Error 404, Security Hack Labs and Kryptón Security for the support they have given me.
